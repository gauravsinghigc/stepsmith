                                       <p>Germany is considered among the top countries in the world for international students, which is not surprising. Over 357,000 foreign students are pursuing university degrees in Germany, and the number is continually rising, according to the most recent official statistics.</p>
<p>Each year, thousands of students from around the globe entrust their educational success to German universities and the reasons for this are obvious.</p>
<p>Germany is the only top study destination where universities donâ€™t charge tuition, despite the fact that higher education is becoming more and more necessary due to the increased demand for highly trained workers and the expense of attending university is rising more quickly.</p>
<p>According to official records from 2018, Germany has 429 operating public higher education institutions, 106 of which are universities. German universities exceed international benchmarks for higher education.</p>
<p>The same rights as German and EU/EFTA citizens in terms of free admission, the ability to study and work without the need for supplementary permissions, apply to students from Europe who desire to live and study in Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to having many universities, Germany also provides a huge selection of degree programmes that are tailored to the interests of every individual. Germany has made significant investments in its engineering colleges as an industrialized nation, and as a result, engineering majors are now highly regarded at German universities. However, these colleges offer a lot more study options, some of which are world leaders in fields like medicine and pharmacy.</p>
<p>In terms of their organization and delivery to students, study programmes at German universities are cutting edge. They are created to keep up with the most recent scientific advancements taking place in the world and to educate people who are capable of taking on major problems.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Germany is fairly reasonable for international students with some careful money management and minor lifestyle adjustments. In general, metropolitan areas should have more expensive goods and services than rural ones.</p>
<p>Your university degree from a German institution is highly regarded and esteemed throughout the world. German graduates have a high employability rate in the international job market, which is evidence of this.</p>
<p>The German language is the most widely spoken native tongue on the European continent, and Germany has one of the strongest economies in the world. German businesses are leaders in the world and have a vast global branch network.</p>
